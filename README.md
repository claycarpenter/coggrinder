CogGrinder is designed to be a quick and easy to use method for interfacing with and managing your Google Tasks without resorting to a web interface. The goal is to provide an interface that is tightly integrated with the user's desktop, allowing the user to work with the tasks (most importantly, creating and viewing) with a minimum of disruption.
